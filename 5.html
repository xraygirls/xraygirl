				<center><img src="img/101ea96785bbad0c56c348280a9d068e.jpg" width="50%"   id="vQl3DInEfBd"></center><br><br><span> </span> Return to site <span> </span> Return to site <h1> <p> How To Do SEO For Your App?</p> </h1> <h2> <p> (It's also called App Store Optimization) </p> </h2> <span> · </span> <span> <span> SEO,</span> <span> Mobile,</span> <span> app</span> </span> <p> When Google introduced its mobile-friendly , it didn’t just affect the websites that were considered mobile friendly. Apps from Google Play also began showing up in search engine result pages as long as they are relevant to the query that the user made. It doesn’t matter whether the user has installed the apps on their device.</p> <p> And what’s more interesting about the organic listing is that they come with an install button. Users can choose to install the app without having to go to the App Store. The user can also be directed to the page that one is looking for if they have already installed the app.</p> <p> With more searches made through mobile devices compared to desktop, it is important for your app to be attractive and visible in mobile searches. This is where SEO comes into play. While mobile app marketing is still the top priority for developers, app store optimization should also be part of the strategy. Below are some of the steps you can do to make the app stand out among its competitors in search results.</p> <p> 1) Name of the App</p> <p> The name of the app must be the same as your existing product or service. This is crucial if you want to be found in Google search, as well as in Google Play searches. The name of the app must include a branded keyword that you are already ranking for.</p> <p> If the brand name is too long, then consider a shorter one that will best fit on the screen of a smartphone. Pick two more keywords that can describe your app and add them next to the app name. This is the same as the SEO practice of adding keywords in the title of an article. They keywords must be relevant and different. They might be highly targeted words that best describe the use of the app.</p> <p> 2) Description of the App</p> <p> The description of the app can be divided into two sections, above and below the fold. The part above the fold must be around one to two sentences long. It should describe the app and its main use. The description below the fold should provide a clear listing of the features of the app. You should use bulleted list to highlight the features.</p> <p> Take note that Google Play has a limit of 4,000 characters for the description. It is important to utilize the right keywords for it. You should avoid duplicate content, as well as false statements. There is also a thing as too much SEO. You should not stuff your description with keywords.</p> <p> 3) Icon of the App</p> <p> While the title and description are important elements of SEO for your app, icons are the first thing that consumers see. There is every instance in which the icon is the reason why users click on the app.</p> <p> When designing the icon, it is important to keep it simple. You should not embellish it with too much elements. You can choose to use your company’s logo as the main design. As much as possible, don’t put in words. Keep the background of the icon soft to make the main element pop out.</p> <p> 4) Keyword Strategy</p> <p> It is important to choose the right keywords that will describe the app and the needs of the potential users. Most SEO practitioners use a Google Keyword Planner tool to find a set of keywords that are relevant to the app.</p> <p> It is recommended to use Latent Semantic Indexing keyword strategy or LSI keywords. They help Google, and other search engines understand what the app is about. When an individual search for a particular item, Google uses the LSI keywords of the site to determine if it is relevant to the search or not.</p> <p> There are several ways to find LSI keywords using Google search. For instance, your app can help reduce anxiety problems, and then the main keyword is anxiety problems. You can find the LSI keywords for the phrase by entering the keyword into Google, and you’ll see the relevant searches, which are LSI keywords.</p> <p> Google also highlights the text that is relevant within the search results. If you look at the results, you will see several highlighted words such as anxiety issues. These are also known as LSI keywords.</p> <p> Lastly, LSI keywords are found at the bottom of the search engine result page. Google displays various keywords that you can use as LSI keywords.</p> <p> 5) Avoid App Interstitials</p> <p> It is important to provide a good user experience to your users. It is a bad idea to prompt visitors of your mobile site to download and install the app via interstitials. They can disrupt the actions of the user and hide the content one is treading. Some interstitials force users to complete more actions that what they have in mind.</p> <p> When the user is already in the process of signing up and the interstitial will only make them go back and search for another. Instead of using interstitial, use a HTML banner at the top of the page instead. Those way users can have the option of installing the app without interrupting what they were doing.</p> <p> 6) Screenshots of App</p> <p> One thing you will notice about the screenshot section of popular apps in Google Play is that they are not really screenshots of the app. Instead, they are promotional graphics that provide more information about the app.</p> <p> When you use an image that explains what the app is above in a more visual way than the description section, then you increase the change of conversions. There should be a buildup of the story from one screenshot to another. That way, the user is rewarded when one scrolls through the images.</p> <p> Conclusion</p> <p> A lot of people are dependent on apps today. There are lots of apps on Google Play and App Store, and the best way to stand out from the crowd is through good SEO practices. By optimizing the app within the app stores, you can reach out to your target market better.</p> Subscribe <span> <span> </span> Previous 7 Best Tools to Help Entrepreneurs to Take Decisions </span> <span> Next<span> </span> The Ultimate Guide To Backlinking Strategies For SEO </span> <span> </span>   Return to site <span> </span> <span> All Posts</span> × <p> Almost done…</p> <p> We just sent you an email.  <strong> Please click the link in the email to confirm your subscription!</strong> </p> <p> OK </p><br>
